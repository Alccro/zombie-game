- Create a simple single player game.
- Utilize project management/cooperation/coding skills learnt so far.

## Game Description

- A player uses the arrow keys to move around the board. 
- Avoid the zombies for as long as possible.
- A player loses a life if they are caught by a zombie.
- The game is over when all lives are lost.

## Project organisation

- Project planned and logic organised using pseudocode.
- Code maintained through Git/GitHub.
- GitHub project used as a kanban board to organise tasks.
- Having a highly organised Project Manager is gold!

## Lessons Learnt

- It is very hard to keep project members in  their 'own lane'.
- The better the encapsulation the easier it is to cooperate.
- Good planning is essential (and hard).
- Good Git skills and practices are really useful.
    (And don't forget to switch branches!)
- Start small with a Minimum Viable Product and build from there.
    It's really easy to get carried away.
